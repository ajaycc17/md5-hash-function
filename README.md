# MD5 Hash function: BS Project- IISERB(2022)

Under the BS project, the working principles of MD5 hash function were studied and used to implement the hash function which can be used to generate hash digests for any string or binary files. MD5 produces 128-bit hash digests. It is not considered as a secure cryptographic hash function anymore and is broken already, MD5 is used for basic checksums and integrity check nowadays. This repository contains both the works combined and uses C programming language for implementation of the function.
