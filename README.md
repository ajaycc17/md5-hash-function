# Implementation of MD5 Hash Function in C
### Under ECS412(BS Project) - April 2022

This is a simple implementation of MD5 hash function in C. MD5 hash
function is not cryptographically secure now, it has already been broken and is used only for local integrity checks and other simple tasks, but it is a great example to understand the concept of hash functions; it introduces message compression using a naive method and then with the help of some non-linear functions on the message, the 128-bit hash for the message is generated. Here, the hash function is implemented in the C programming language for simple string values. You can see the implementation of BLAKE-256 Hash function [here](https://github.com/ajaycc17/blake-256-hash-function).
